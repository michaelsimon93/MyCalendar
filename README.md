There's something wrong with my AppDelegate file because all the try-catch statements are giving me errors. Not exactly sure why this
is happening because I've compared it others in this class and it is exactly the same. Due to this, I can't compile my code to see if 
it has full functionality. Auto-layout should be working, and all the code is in place to implement functionality. The TA's were supposed
to show up to lab on Friday to help with any homework problems, but none of them showed up so I couldn't receive help with this. I have
spent a fair amount of time trying to figure out this problem and can't come to any conclussion.
