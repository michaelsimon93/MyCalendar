There's something wrong with my AppDelegate file because all the try-catch statements are giving me errors. Not exactly sure why this
is happening because I've compared it others in this class and it is exactly the same. Due to this, I can't compile my code to see if 
it has full functionality. Auto-layout should be working, and all the code is in place to implement functionality. 

This might have been caused becaues my xCode was not the newest version. I am downloading the newest version so hopefully that helps.
